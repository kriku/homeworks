\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This requirements specification document describes the functions and requirements specified for ``Lift Controller''. Also it will illustrate constraints and quality attributes.

This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and a reference for developing the first version of the system for the development team. But it is written like you know nothing about the lift.

\subsection{Scope}

Lift Controller supposed to use on hardware system, full list of components will describe later. It must controll lift motors, indicators and sensors. Also it must provide safety, call servicing, performance, reliability.

The maximun number of controlling lifts - four lifts per controller, 20 floors. One lift per shaft. All lifts are same numbers of floors. But on common model it could be different.

So at the bottom line, this system is controlled by the people near or inside it. Also guaranteed limited access (could be remote) to the system administration.

A distinctive feature of this device is that it really can kill you, so at least cabin shouldn't smash the floor. Also should be instructions, how to use the lift, maximum load, and other important information, both inside and outside cab. In case of getting stuck in the lift, the cab is provided with a communication service.

\subsection{Functionality}
All lifts, if there're more than one, must be used approximately same. The system can change state (according current) by commands received from command interfaces.

Lift Controller's interfaces:

{\ttfamily
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Root control panel
  \item
  Floor control buttons
  \item
  Cabin control panel {\itshape\small\color{SlateGray}(could include authentication middleware)}
\end{itemize}
}

A main function is assumes, to transport people and other different goods in vertical direction, up and down. Every floor have a number. To get them designed special shaft, with movable cabin. It is prohibited to access shaft outside the cabin\footnote{%
With the exception of technical staff.}.
On the first and last floors lift must be fully be stopped. On every\footnote{%
Can be limited access. This is about authentication issue.}
floor doors can be opened and closed, depending on the state.

\subsection{Logic}
\label{sub:Logic}
Logic for determining priority of actions may vary. But in common case lift circulates through the mine or stay in static. So we can highlight five\footnote{%
Normal mode is only three of them.}
basic state: \\

\begin{tabular}{ll}
  \hline
  \texttt{Off} & - not powered, in static position.\\
  \texttt{On (Pending)} & - ready to go, powered, but in static.\\
  \texttt{Move} & - in action.\\
  \texttt{Broken} & - powered, but can't function.\\
  \texttt{Drop down} & - emergency case.\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}\\

\section{Glossary}
\label{sec:Glossary}

\begin{description}
  \item[Floor control button(s)] \hfill\\
  Intuitive interface, for call lift. Futher in the text just \texttt{button}. Could be single or double control buttons for lift call in both directions.
  \item[Cabin control panel] \hfill\\
  Complex of buttons, for selection of floor, canceling action, calling services, and management additional functions inside the cabin of lift, like doors managing or cooling system.
  \item[Root control panel] \hfill\\
  Interface (could be remote) for controling state off all lifts. Access to this panel granted only for technical staff.
  \item[Control devices] \hfill\\
  This group of units include buttons, controllers, buses to them, and considered as a self-contained device with declared I/O protocols. Like lift controller, door's motor controller, light controller, etc.
  \item[Control interface (bus access)] \hfill\\
  End-user control points, like floor buttons, cabin's panel, root panel (bus access), power switchers, etc.
  \item[Sensors] \hfill\\
  System units with declared I/O protocols, to provide data feedback about lift system state. It include floor lift sensors, door collision sensor, weight sensors, etc.
  \item[Indicators] \hfill\\
  Output channels for displaying system status. For example lift status indicators (displays current floor), button state indicators (highlight pushed button), sound speakers and so on.
  \item[Authentication middleware] \hfill\\
  Autonomous unit that provides limited access, whatever how. It could be firegerprint access or card key. But should provide I/O standardized connections to other control units.
  \item[Hardware system] \hfill\\
  In this case the system is complex of hardware units that perform the main function of the system. Include:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textsc{Power source}
    \item \textsc{Movable mechanisms}
    \item \textsc{Control devices}
    \item \textsc{Control interfaces (bus access)}
    \item \textsc{Sensors system}
    \item \textsc{Indicators complex}
    {\color{SlateGray}\item \textsc{Authentication middlemare}}
  \end{itemize}
  {\color{SlateGray}
  As mentioned earlier system can also include authentication access on some (or all) floors. This middleware can be implemented separately from the system. Here and further colored in gray as not mandatory.}
